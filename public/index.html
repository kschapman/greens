          <h2 class="james-heading">James' Story</h2><p class="james-text">Green Party Co-leader James Shaw strongly believes that New Zealand can lead the world in transitioning to a high-value, clean-tech, post-carbon economy that works for everyone.
          <br><br>He knows it’s a hugely ambitious, probably decades-long task, but it’s the reason he’s committed to a life in politics and one of the many reasons joined the Green Party in 1990.
          <br><br>James was appointed Green Party Co-leader on May 30, 2015, after being elected to Parliament as a list MP in 2014.
          <br><br>Prior to becoming an MP, James had a successful career in management consulting, primarily in London, where he lived from 1998 to 2010.
          <br><br>While there, he worked with large, multinational companies across Europe and around the world, developing their sustainable business practices.
          <br><br>It was while James was in the UK, studying for a Master’s degree in sustainable development and business leadership, that he realised that the private sector alone wasn’t able to affect change at the speed and scale necessary to meet the great challenges of our time.
          <br><br>With that realisation also came a call to action, and James moved back to Wellington, the city where he was born and raised, with the aim of being elected to Parliament.
          <br><br>James believes that, with vision and purpose, politicians can bring the large-scale, transformational change that is needed to build a truly inclusive economy, and a healthier planet.
          <br><br>His diverse business experience and expertise, from working for multinational corporates through to local start-ups and community organisations, will enable him to lead the Green Party and New Zealanders towards a high-tech post-carbon economy and society.
          <br><br>It might be the biggest challenge of a generation, but James also sees it as the greatest opportunity: he wants New Zealand to lead the way and show the world how it’s done.
          <br><br>When he’s not living and breathing sustainable economics, James enjoys spending time in his local community, Aro Valley, with his wife Annabel.</p>
